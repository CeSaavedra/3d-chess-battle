# Chess Battle 3D v0.0.0

## Project Description

The Project we are creating is a web-based 3D Chess game with player versus player multiplayer. The players will be able to log in and register an account which will be stored in a database properly. The database will track the user’s win-loss record and additional account information. The player will be able to matchmake with another player and they will be taken to a game UI. The game UI will present a chess board using 3D graphics that they can manipulate to play against another player in chess.
